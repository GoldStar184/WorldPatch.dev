# WorldPatch.dev

Welcome to **WorldPatch.dev** — a joke website dedicated to publishing “patch notes” for the planet Earth. Ever wondered what would happen if reality got regular updates like your favorite software? Here, you’ll find tongue-in-cheek changelogs, bug fixes, and new “features” for life on Earth.

## What is This?

WorldPatch.dev is a satirical project that posts fictional patch notes for the world. Each entry imagines what would happen if the Earth received regular software updates — including balance changes, bug fixes, and the occasional surprise feature.

All “patch notes” are published as posts in the `_posts` directory, following the style of software changelogs.

- Posts written in classic changelog style for maximum comedy
- Powered by static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme
