## Changes
- Enhanced moon shininess patch is now compatible with cloudier nights.
- Reduced the likelihood of leaves assembling into cryptic patterns during solstice events.
- Added mild static to radio stations during dramatic weather.
- Improved sandwich structural integrity: tomatoes now 4% less likely to escape.
- Made shadows 1% more dramatic after 5pm.
- Elevator doors now close with 0.2% more confidence.
- Keys are now slightly more likely to remain where last placed.
- Mirrors now consistently display only the standard level of enthusiasm, regardless of the day of the week.

## Known Bugs
- Stacking a 10,000th cup may result in the entire stack phasing gently through the floor.
- Cats may still appear in locations they were not seen entering. Cat teleportation remains poorly understood.
- Some cats have been observed briefly behaving as if liquid.
- Socks are still escaping from laundry baskets, especially on Tuesdays.
- Squirrels sometimes forget where they buried their acorns, leading to spontaneous oak tree generation.
- Traffic lights occasionally synchronize in ways that defy probability.
