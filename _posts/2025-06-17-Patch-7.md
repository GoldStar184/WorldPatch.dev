## Changes
- Fixed an issue causing the last two patch notes to not post on time; they have now been restored and backdated for continuity.
- Patch notes now retroactively synchronized with the proper flow of time.
- Added a note about comments to the feedback section for improved user participation.
- Shoelace logic module recompiled to address rare double-knot paradoxes.
- Cup stacking warning chime now harmonizes with local mug dialects.
- Cats exhibiting quantum behavior are now gently encouraged to localize before breakfast.
- Elevator button resistance now calibrated to distinguish between elbows, foreheads, and robust optimism.

## Known Bugs
- Stacking a 10,000th cup may result in the entire stack phasing gently through the floor.
- Some cats have been observed briefly behaving as if liquid.
- Cats may still appear in locations they were not seen entering.
- Traffic lights occasionally synchronize in ways that defy probability.
- Squirrels sometimes forget where they buried their acorns, leading to spontaneous oak tree generation.
- Socks remain prone to Tuesday escapes, despite reinforced threading.
- Mirrors occasionally reflect a surplus of enthusiasm on minor holidays.
- Elevator doors may develop an existential pause before closing if observed too intently.
