## Changes
- A soft cap on cup stacking now gently chimes at 9,999, using resonant mug acoustics to deter overenthusiastic stacking.
- Shoelaces now reference a basic logic engine before self-untangling, reducing spontaneous untying during routine walks by 5%.
- Elevator buttons now detect elbow-presses via subtle pressure differentials and respond with dignified resistance.
- Squirrel memory was updated using a daylight-activated cache refresh, boosting acorn retrieval accuracy by 0.5% while the sun is up.
- Cloud pattern rendering now checks a cryptic-message blacklist from 2â€“4 a.m., minimizing unintentional omens.
- Sock containment protocols have been reinforced with anti-escape threading, reducing Tuesday disappearances by 2%.
- Cat teleportation is now monitored by quantum event loggers. So far, logs are mostly paw prints.
- Mirror reflection enthusiasm is now synchronized to national holiday calendars, ensuring appropriate levels of pep.

## Known Bugs
- Stacking a 10,000th cup may result in the entire stack phasing gently through the floor.
- Some cats have been observed briefly behaving as if liquid.
- Cats may still appear in locations they were not seen entering.
- Traffic lights occasionally synchronize in ways that defy probability.
- Squirrels sometimes forget where they buried their acorns, leading to spontaneous oak tree generation.
- Elevator doors may develop an existential pause before closing if observed too intently.
