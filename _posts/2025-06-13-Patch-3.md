## Changes
- Fixed a bug causing shopping carts to veer slightly left for no discernible reason.
- Mechanical pencils are now 6% less likely to break under normal writing pressure.
- Cloud shapes are now 8% more recognizable as animals.
- Slightly improved the odds of remembering what you walked into the kitchen for.
- Coffee now cools 0.5% slower on rainy days.

## Known Bugs
- The faint aroma of toast might occur in elevator lobbies without any nearby kitchen facilities.
- Keys are commonly not where they should be.
- Squirrels sometimes forget where they buried their acorns, leading to spontaneous oak tree generation.

- Some shoelaces may spontaneously untie themselves when no one is looking.
- Socks placed on beds may migrate to the floor overnight without user input.
- Feline movement patterns remain partially governed by quantum uncertainty, resulting in apparent teleportation.
